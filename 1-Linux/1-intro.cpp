 * INTRODUCTION TO LINUX
 * ==================================================
 *
 * What is Linux?
 * - Linux is based on UNIX
 * - Linux is NOT an operating system
 * - Linux is a KERNEL
 *
 * Kernel:
 * - The kernel is the core part of an operating system
 * - It manages:
 *   - CPU
 *   - Memory
 *   - Processes
 *   - Hardware communication
 *
 * Analogy (Easy to understand):
 * - Linux ko ENGINE samjho
 * - Engine sabhi cars me use hota hai
 * - Lekin har car ka design, features aur comfort alag hota hai
 *
 * - Engine same ho sakta hai
 * - Par car ke features alag-alag hote hain
 *
 * ==================================================
 * LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS (DISTROS)
 * ==================================================
 *
 * Linux Distribution:
 * - An operating system made from a collection of software
 * - It includes:
 *   - Linux Kernel
 *   - System utilities
 *   - Package Management System
 *   - User Interface (CLI / GUI)
 *
 * Examples of Linux-based Operating Systems:
 * - Ubuntu
 * - CentOS
 * - Fedora
 * - Debian
 *
 * Note:
 * - Ubuntu, CentOS etc. are OPERATING SYSTEMS
 * - Linux is the KERNEL used inside them
 *
 * ==================================================
 * KEY FEATURES OF LINUX
 * ==================================================
 *
 * 1) Open Source
 *    - Source code is freely available
 *    - Anyone can modify and distribute it
 *
 * 2) Multi-user
 *    - Multiple users can work at the same time
 *
 * 3) Multitasking
 *    - Multiple processes can run simultaneously
 *
 * 4) Security
 *    - Strong permission system
 *    - Fewer viruses compared to other OS
 *
 * 5) Portability
 *    - Runs on different hardware platforms
 *
 * ==================================================
 * BENEFITS OF LINUX (PLACEMENTS POV)
 * ==================================================
 *
 * - Widely used in servers and cloud
 * - Important for DevOps and Backend roles
 * - Strong demand in Data Engineering and AI
 * - Preferred OS for coding interviews and development
 *
 * ==================================================
 * DOMAINS WHERE LINUX IS USED
 * ==================================================
 *
 * - Servers and Data Centers
 * - Cloud Computing (AWS, GCP, Azure)
 * - DevOps and SRE
 * - Cyber Security
 * - Embedded Systems
 * - Android OS
 * - Data Science and Machine Learning
