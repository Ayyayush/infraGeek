/**
 * Workflow in Git & GitHub
 *
 * 1) What is a Repository?
 *    - A repository (repo) is a place where your project’s code,
 *      files, and version history are stored.
 *    - It can be local (on your system) or remote (on GitHub).
 *
 * 2) Working Directory
 *    - The working directory is the project folder on your system.
 *    - Files here are NOT tracked by Git until Git is initialized.
 *    - Changes made here are untracked or modified.
 *
 * 3) Git Initialization
 *    - `git init` converts a normal folder into a Git repository.
 *    - After this, Git starts tracking changes.
 *
 * 4) Staging Area
 *    - The staging area is an intermediate place where changes
 *      are prepared before committing.
 *    - `git add` moves changes from working directory to staging area.
 *
 * 5) Local Repository
 *    - The local repository stores committed snapshots of code.
 *    - `git commit` saves changes permanently with a message.
 *
 * 6) Remote Repository
 *    - A remote repository exists on platforms like GitHub.
 *    - It is used for backup, collaboration, and deployment.
 *
 * 7) Git Workflow
 *    Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository
 *
 * 8) Common Commands
 *    - git add      → Stage changes
 *    - git commit   → Save changes locally
 *    - git push     → Send commits to remote repository
 *
